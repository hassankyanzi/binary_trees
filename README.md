<h1>0x1D. C - Binary trees</h1>
<p>
This project is about Binary Trees in C and data structures of other tree-type.

All files were create and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
</p>

<p>All files were linted for syntax and style with Betty</p>
